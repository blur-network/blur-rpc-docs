# Blur Network RPC Documentation
Docs for the Blur Network Daemon-RPC and Wallet-RPC Interfaces (wallet not uploaded yet).

The html pages uploaded here use a modified stylesheet from <a href="https://github.com/PrismJS/prism">Prism.js</a> syntax highlighting for code blocks and inline code.  These docs have been adapted from the <a href="https://ww.getmonero.org/resources/developer-guides/daemon-rpc.html">Monero Daemon-RPC documentation</a>, to be applicable to BLUR.  Information is mostly up-to-date as of block height 429811.
